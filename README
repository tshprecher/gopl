This repo intends to supplement my reading of "The Go Programming Language"
by D&K. Rather than pausing at the end of every section and chapter to code
up the exercises, I decided to write something small, if not particularly
useful, to cover the salient features of the language.

The 'sudoku' project in this repo serves that purpose. At the end of chapter 5,
I paused my reading to write the basic solver that fetches problems from
websudoku.com. This covered many of the language's features, including:

  - functions
  - slices
  - maps
  - structs
  - pointers
  - deferred calls
  - first class functions
  - practice using "net/http" library
  - practice using "golang.org/x/net/html" library for scraping puzzles
  - practice using "testing" library (although not covered until a later chapter)

I tried my best to use only what was covered up to chapter 5. The use of go's
"testing" library is a notable exception. After I completed TGPL, I went back
and added support for batch downloading/solving, parallel execution, godoc
documentation, and proper command line parsing. Those changes covered the
following:

  - struct methods
  - channels
  - creating goroutines with the 'go' command
  - practice using "flag" library for command line parsing
  - practice using/reading "text/scanner" library for writing and reading puzzles
  - practice using the error, io.{Reader, Writer} standard interfaces
  - practice writing proper godoc documentation

I tried my best to do things the "Go way" with proper error checking, etc. All
code written with the sole purpose of understanding more about the Go programming
language will be added to this repo.

Now, on to more interesting (and useful) projects.
