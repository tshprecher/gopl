This project downloads and solves an arbitrary number of sudoku
puzzles. It was written purely for educational purposes. The
binary can be generated with the standard "go get" command.

The binary runs in two modes, downloading and solving.

-- Downloading

To download puzzles, pass in the '-dl' flag. All puzzles are
downloaded from websudoku.com. Note: if you download too many,
I heard they will block your IP. Don't complain to me if that
happens.

  -- downloads a single puzzle with level=1 and id=2
  $ echo "1 2" | ./sudoku -dl > single_puzzle.out

  -- downloads 10 random puzzles
  $ ./sudoku -dl -n 10 > ten_random_puzzles.out

-- Solving

To solve puzzles, omit the '-dl' flag.

  # downloads and solves a puzzle with level=1 and id=2
  $ ./sudoku -level 1 -id 2

  # reads puzzles from a file, solves serially
  $ ./sudoku < ten_random_puzzles.out > ten_random_puzzles_solved_ser.out

  # reads puzzles from a file, solves in parallel. this should be at
  # least 2x faster on multi-core cpus.
  $ ./sudoku -par < ten_random_puzzles.out > ten_random_puzzles_solved_par.out

That's it. Nothing too special. If you have any comments, questions,
