This project downloads and solves an arbitrary number of sudoku
puzzles. It was written purely to get more comfortable with C#.
You will need the `dotnet` binary installed to run.

There are two operations, fetching and solving.

-- Downloading

To download puzzles, pass in the '-dl' flag. All puzzles are
downloaded from websudoku.com. Note: if you download too many,
I heard they will block your IP.

  -- downloads a single puzzle with level=1 and id=2
  $ ./sudoku -dl -level 1 -id 2 > single_puzzle.out

  -- downloads 10 random puzzles
  $ ./sudoku -dl -n 10 > ten_random_puzzles.out

-- Solving

To solve puzzles, omit the '-dl' flag.

  # downloads and solves a puzzle with level=1 and id=2
  $ ./sudoku -level 1 -id 2

  # reads puzzles from a file, solves serially
  $ ./sudoku < ten_random_puzzles.out > ten_random_puzzles_solved_ser.out

That's it. Nothing special.
